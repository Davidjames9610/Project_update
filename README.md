# Project_update
David Edwards Skripsie 2019

A software synthersizer built using JUCE C++ application framework framework in C++.
The idea was to create something simmilar to https://soundbridge.io/prismizer/, used by Bon Iver.

The two inputs are:
- midi input, in the form of a midi keyboard or midi information.
- vocal input, from a singer.

Output:
- pitchshifted vocals harmonies of the midi notes pressed.

Good functionality and quality achieved, the plugin was tested in the DAW Fl Studio.
